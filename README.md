Estimate Satoshi Nakamoto's BTC holdings and simulate immediate liquidation against a live, aggregated multiâ€‘exchange order book (Coinbase, Binance, Bybit, OKX). Upbit excluded from aggregation (KRW quote) pending FX conversion logic.

## Features

- Simple heuristic holdings estimate (override with `--btc`)
- Fetches and aggregates live order book bids (public endpoints: Coinbase BTC-USD, Binance BTCUSDT, Bybit BTCUSDT, OKX BTC-USDT)
- Simulates market sell sweeping best bids first across all included exchanges
- Reports realized USD, average execution price, and price impact vs current Coinbase spot (when available)
- CLI via `npx tsx src/cli.ts`
- Tested with Vitest

## Install & Run

```bash
npm install
npx tsx src/cli.ts
# override assumed holdings
npx tsx src/cli.ts --btc 900000
```

## Output Example

```
Timestamp: 2025-08-15T12:34:56.000Z
Assumed Satoshi Holdings: 1,000,000 BTC (range 600,000 - 1,100,000 BTC)
Simulated Immediate Liquidation (aggregated bids: COINBASE,BINANCE,BYBIT,OKX):
  Realized USD: $18,532,000,000
  Average Realized Price: $18,532.00 per BTC
  Unsold (insufficient bids): 0 BTC (0%)
```

(Values above illustrative; depends on live order book.)

## Tests

```bash
npm test
```

## Bill Gates Equity Liquidation CLI (Alltick Order Book)

Additionally, a simulator estimates proceeds if Bill Gates attempted to instantly liquidate several major public equity holdings (static snapshot). It uses ONLY live Alltick bid depth (no synthetic fallback). If no bid data returns for a symbol, that symbol contributes zero realized USD and all shares remain unsold.

Key points:
- Fetches Alltick order book depth (bids) per symbol. Only the returned bid levels are used; asks are irrelevant for a sell sweep.
- No synthetic depth beyond what Alltick provides.
- Average execution price = realized USD / filled shares (if any).
- Unfilled shares are reported; they produce no proceeds.

### Authentication (Recommended)

Set an Alltick API token via environment variable `ALLTICK_TOKEN` for higher rate limits / reliability:

```bash
export ALLTICK_TOKEN="your-token-here"
npx tsx src/gatesCli.ts
```

If `ALLTICK_TOKEN` is not set, the CLI attempts unauthenticated requests (may be rate limited or fail). Missing token is non-fatal; symbols failing to fetch simply yield zero proceeds.

### Run

```bash
npx tsx src/gatesCli.ts
```

### Disclaimers
* Depth is partial: only top-of-book levels exposed by Alltick are considered; true market impact for a full liquidation would be vastly greater.
* Holdings list is static and may be outdated; not refreshed automatically.
* Results are illustrative only and not investment advice.

## Notes

- Uses public exchange REST endpoints (no API keys needed for depth) for order books.
  - Coinbase (BTC-USD): https://api.exchange.coinbase.com/products/BTC-USD/book?level=2
  - Binance (BTCUSDT): https://api.binance.com/api/v3/depth?symbol=BTCUSDT&limit=1000
  - Bybit (BTCUSDT, spot): https://api.bybit.com/v5/market/orderbook?category=spot&symbol=BTCUSDT
  - OKX (BTC-USDT): https://www.okx.com/api/v5/market/books?instId=BTC-USDT
  - Upbit (KRW-BTC) available but excluded from aggregation until FX conversion is implemented
- Level 2 book gives aggregated depth; real slippage could differ.
- Holdings estimate is speculative; not financial advice.
- Bill Gates equity liquidation simulation is an approximation; real market impact would be vastly larger and more complex.
