# real-satoshi-net-worth

Estimate Satoshi Nakamoto's BTC holdings and simulate immediate liquidation against a live, aggregated multi‑exchange order book (Coinbase, Binance, Bybit, OKX). Upbit excluded from aggregation (KRW quote) pending FX conversion logic.

## Features

- Simple heuristic holdings estimate (override with `--btc`)
- Fetches and aggregates live order book bids (public endpoints: Coinbase BTC-USD, Binance BTCUSDT, Bybit BTCUSDT, OKX BTC-USDT)
- Simulates market sell sweeping best bids first across all included exchanges
- Reports realized USD, average execution price, and price impact vs current Coinbase spot (when available)
- CLI via `npx tsx src/cli.ts`
- Tested with Vitest
- Optional Bill Gates stocks comparator (very rough; see section below)

## Install & Run

```bash
npm install
npx tsx src/cli.ts
# override assumed holdings
npx tsx src/cli.ts --btc 900000
```

## Output Example

```
Timestamp: 2025-08-15T12:34:56.000Z
Assumed Satoshi Holdings: 1,000,000 BTC (range 600,000 - 1,100,000 BTC)
Simulated Immediate Liquidation (aggregated bids: COINBASE,BINANCE,BYBIT,OKX):
  Realized USD: $18,532,000,000
  Average Realized Price: $18,532.00 per BTC
  Unsold (insufficient bids): 0 BTC (0%)
```

(Values above illustrative; depends on live order book.)

## Tests

```bash
npm test
```

## Key learning: liquidity is not someone’s full balance sitting on the spot book

Large holders do not keep all their funds in spot orders. Most of the time, only a fraction of aggregate willingness-to-buy is visible in the live book at any moment. For huge liquidations, you typically have to pace orders and wait for the book to replenish as market makers and other participants update quotes. This repo’s core simulator intentionally models a naive “instant sweep” to highlight how quickly the visible book exhausts; real execution would be throttled and staged over time.

## Bill Gates Net Worth (Stocks) – rough comparator via Alltick

For comparison with a non-crypto large-holder scenario, there is a very rough simulator that estimates proceeds if Bill Gates instantly liquidated parts of several public equity positions. It is primarily illustrative and often does not work very well in practice due to data gaps.

It uses ONLY live Alltick bid depth (no synthetic fallback). If no bid data returns for a symbol, that symbol contributes zero realized USD and all shares remain unsold.

Key points:
- Fetches Alltick order book depth (bids) per symbol. Only the returned bid levels are used; asks are irrelevant for a sell sweep.
- No synthetic depth beyond what Alltick provides.
- Average execution price = realized USD / filled shares (if any).
- Unfilled shares are reported; they produce no proceeds.
- Rough/fragile in practice: limited symbol coverage, rate limits, and shallow depth often lead to partial or zero fills.

### Authentication (Recommended)

Set an Alltick API token via environment variable `ALLTICK_TOKEN` for higher rate limits / reliability:

```bash
export ALLTICK_TOKEN="your-token-here"
npx tsx src/gatesCli.ts
```

If `ALLTICK_TOKEN` is not set, the CLI attempts unauthenticated requests (may be rate limited or fail). Missing token is non-fatal; symbols failing to fetch simply yield zero proceeds.

### Run

```bash
npx tsx src/gatesCli.ts
```

### Disclaimers
* Depth is partial: only top-of-book levels exposed by Alltick are considered; true market impact for a full liquidation would be vastly greater.
* Holdings list is static and may be outdated; not refreshed automatically.
* Results are illustrative only and not investment advice.
* This comparator is brittle and may return zero or inconsistent data—treat outputs as an impression, not a measurement.

## Notes

- Uses public exchange REST endpoints (no API keys needed for depth) for order books.
  - Coinbase (BTC-USD): https://api.exchange.coinbase.com/products/BTC-USD/book?level=2
  - Binance (BTCUSDT): https://api.binance.com/api/v3/depth?symbol=BTCUSDT&limit=1000
  - Bybit (BTCUSDT, spot): https://api.bybit.com/v5/market/orderbook?category=spot&symbol=BTCUSDT
  - OKX (BTC-USDT): https://www.okx.com/api/v5/market/books?instId=BTC-USDT
  - Upbit (KRW-BTC) available but excluded from aggregation until FX conversion is implemented
- Level 2 book gives aggregated depth; real slippage could differ.
- Holdings estimate is speculative; not financial advice.
- Bill Gates equity liquidation simulation is an approximation; real market impact would be vastly larger and more complex.
