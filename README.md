Estimate Satoshi Nakamoto's BTC holdings and simulate immediate liquidation against Coinbase BTC-USD order book depth.

## Features

- Simple heuristic holdings estimate (override with `--btc`)
- Fetches live Coinbase aggregated order book (level 2)
- Simulates market sell sweeping bids to compute realized USD and average price
- CLI via `npx tsx src/cli.ts`
- Tested with Vitest

## Install & Run

```bash
npm install
npx tsx src/cli.ts
# or override assumed holdings
npx tsx src/cli.ts --btc 900000
```

## Output Example

```
Timestamp: 2025-08-15T12:34:56.000Z
Assumed Satoshi Holdings: 1,000,000 BTC (range 600,000 - 1,100,000 BTC)
Simulated Immediate Liquidation (sweeping bids on Coinbase BTC-USD):
  Realized USD: $18,532,000,000
  Average Realized Price: $18,532.00 per BTC
  Levels Consumed: 275
```

(Values above illustrative; depends on live order book.)

## Tests

```bash
npm test
```

## Notes

- Uses public Coinbase Exchange REST endpoint (no auth) for order book.
- Level 2 book gives aggregated depth; real slippage could differ.
- Holdings estimate is speculative; not financial advice.
