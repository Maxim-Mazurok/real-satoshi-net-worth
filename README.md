Estimate Satoshi Nakamoto's BTC holdings and simulate immediate liquidation against a live, aggregated multiâ€‘exchange order book (Coinbase, Binance, Bybit, OKX). Upbit excluded from aggregation (KRW quote) pending FX conversion logic.

## Features

- Simple heuristic holdings estimate (override with `--btc`)
- Fetches and aggregates live order book bids (public endpoints: Coinbase BTC-USD, Binance BTCUSDT, Bybit BTCUSDT, OKX BTC-USDT)
- Simulates market sell sweeping best bids first across all included exchanges
- Reports realized USD, average execution price, and price impact vs current Coinbase spot (when available)
- CLI via `npx tsx src/cli.ts`
- Tested with Vitest

## Install & Run

```bash
npm install
npx tsx src/cli.ts
# override assumed holdings
npx tsx src/cli.ts --btc 900000
```

## Output Example

```
Timestamp: 2025-08-15T12:34:56.000Z
Assumed Satoshi Holdings: 1,000,000 BTC (range 600,000 - 1,100,000 BTC)
Simulated Immediate Liquidation (aggregated bids: COINBASE,BINANCE,BYBIT,OKX):
  Realized USD: $18,532,000,000
  Average Realized Price: $18,532.00 per BTC
  Unsold (insufficient bids): 0 BTC (0%)
```

(Values above illustrative; depends on live order book.)

## Tests

```bash
npm test
```

## Notes

- Uses public exchange REST endpoints (no API keys needed for depth) for order books.
  - Coinbase (BTC-USD): https://api.exchange.coinbase.com/products/BTC-USD/book?level=2
  - Binance (BTCUSDT): https://api.binance.com/api/v3/depth?symbol=BTCUSDT&limit=1000
  - Bybit (BTCUSDT, spot): https://api.bybit.com/v5/market/orderbook?category=spot&symbol=BTCUSDT
  - OKX (BTC-USDT): https://www.okx.com/api/v5/market/books?instId=BTC-USDT
  - Upbit (KRW-BTC) available but excluded from aggregation until FX conversion is implemented
- Level 2 book gives aggregated depth; real slippage could differ.
- Holdings estimate is speculative; not financial advice.
